# React Website Example

This project is a React-based website featuring a homepage, services, products, and a sign-up page. It's my first React project, which I built by following a tutorial by Brian Design on YouTube.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

Install project dependencies:
npm install

Start the application in development mode:
npm start

This will open a new browser window running the project.

Built With
React.js - The web framework used
React Router - Page routing library
Font Awesome - Icons used
